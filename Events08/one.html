    // As we know javascript is a sequential running language. Every sequence is run after another sequence.

    //some events happen on the browser which are evoked after any kind of activity.

    //These activity is known as the events.

    //The activity can be of many types as mouse hovering, mouse clicked, double clicked, keyboard's value clicked, drag and drop, etc.
     

    // let us target the <li> with the id of "owl"  
    //  <li><img width="200px" id="owl" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3532552/pexels-photo-3532552.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600&lazy=load" alt="" onclick="alert('owl clicked')"></li>
    
    // 1st approach

    //Writing onclick="" in an html tag itself  for a click event may not be a very good approach when the scale is large.
    // It is not recommended

    // 2nd approach 

    //document.getElementById("owl").onclick = ()=> {
     //   alert("owl is clicked")
    //}
    // This approach can also be accepted but the event listener features not only provides the click events but also different events.
    // So this approach is also not recommended.

    // 3rd or best approach 

    // In this approach we have to target the id as always.
    // and with event listener () we give the type of event and another parameter as false which is by default.
   /*document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
         alert("owl is clicked again")
    },false)*/

    //We also get an event object

    document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
         alert("owl is clicked again")
         console.log(e);
         console.log(e.currentTarget);
         console.log(e.target);
         // we get the browser event as well as environmental events
         console.log(e.clientX);
         console.log(e.clientY);
         console.log(e.screenX);
         console.log(e.screenY);
         console.log(e);
         
        
         //We get the browser event as well as environmental events

    },false)

    // topics should be studied about the below event object's topic

    // type, timestamp, defaultPrevented, target, toElement , srcElement, currentTarget , clientX, clientY, screenX , ScreenY 

    // e.type

    console.log(e.type); // click
     // It returns the result as a string and the result would be the type of event.

    // e.timestamp
    console.log(e.timeStamp); // 1423.45444 (in milli second)

    // The timeStamp event property returns the number of milliseconds from when the document was finished loading until the specific event was created.
    // Not all systems provide this information, therefore, timeStamp may be not available for all systems/events.

    // defaultPrevented

    // The defaultPrevented event property checks whether the preventDefault() method was called for the event.
    // as we know the preventDefault() method holds the value 

    // target

    console.log(e.target);

    // The target property returns the element where the event occurred.

    // toElement
      console.log(e.toElement());
    // It's a property of the event object (e) that retrieves a reference to the element that the mouse pointer entered during specific mouse events.


    // currentTarget
    
      console.log(e.currentTarget);

    // the currentTarget property returns the element whose event listener triggered the event.

    // clientX

     console.log(e.clientX);

    // The clientX property returns the horizontal client coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.
    // It only shows the value if the gets clicked in the client Area.
    // The client area is the current targeted (event occurring) window.

    // clientY

     console.log(e.clientY);

    // The clientY property returns the vertical client coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.
    // It only shows the value if the gets clicked in the client Area.
    // The client area is the current targeted (event occurring) window.


    // screenX
     console.log(e.screenX);

    //The screenX property returns the x (horizontal) coordinate of a window, relative to the screen.

    //screenY

      console.log(e.screenY);

     //The screenY property returns the y (vertical) coordinate of a window, relative to the screen.

     // EVENT PROPAGATION
     
    // Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events propagate or travel through the DOM tree to arrive at its target and what happens to it afterward.

    // There are two ways 

    // 1.Event bubbling

    // When an event happens first the event target all goes through the event handler or the targeted element, then to its parent element.
    // It is called an event bubbling
    // As we learned the parameter given while adding an event listener the third parameter needed to be given as false.
    // No 3rd parameters also refer to false by default.
    
    // example
    

    
    document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
         console.log("owl is clicked ")
    },false)

    document.getElementById("images").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
         console.log("image  is clicked ")
    },false)
    

    /* the result is
    owl is clicked (1st)
    image  is clicked (2nd) 
    */

    // As we know the "images" id is the parent of the "owl" id.
    //If we click on the owl image (with the false parameter or no parameter), first it targets the child then the parent.
    // It travels bottom to top in dom tree
    // It is called as event bubbling.

    // 2. Event capturing
    // It first captures  the outermost element and propagates to the inner elements.
    // It travels from top to bottom or from parents to children.
    // with the true parameter mentioned

    // EXAMPLE

    document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
         console.log("owl is clicked ")
    },true)

    document.getElementById("images").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
         console.log("image  is clicked ")
    },true)


    /*
    result 
    image  is clicked (1st)
     owl is clicked    (2nd)
     */
